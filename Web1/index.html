Green screen is the chroma key effect that adds or change video that place into the green screen. It is not necessarily to have a bulb(s) or lighting(s) for the green screen, you only need lighting(s) and bulbs(s) when the room is too dark or when the object(s) has a lot of shadows. In <i>BAGUNDAH: The Little Bugs In California,</i> it is not really necessarily to use a green screen, I only use green screen on Iyan3D pro. However, it depends on your storyboard.</h6>

After we done using blender, we have to export our 3D model and texture to Iyan3D or the pro version, but I will use the pro version becaues there is a new feature of .fbx file, .dae file, and more. You can export Iyan3D, but it only export .obj and texture file. If you are ready to export your 3d model and texture, I highly recommend to export .dae file because it is much very convenient for Iyan3D pro and it combines 3D model(s) and texture(s).
